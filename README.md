# Shell

This repo contains a project to implement a shell.
The implementation can be found in [tsh.c](shlab-handout1/tsh.c).

Basic features include handling commands with pipes (```|```) and modifying file descriptors (```<``` for read mode and ```>``` for write).
See [shlab1.pdf](shlab1.pdf) for more information (which includes information on how to run the shell and its tests).
